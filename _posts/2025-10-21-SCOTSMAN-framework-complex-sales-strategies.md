## What is the SCOTSMAN Framework?

The SCOTSMAN framework is an acronym-driven checklist designed to ensure opportunities are rigorously qualified before your team invests time and resources. Established by professional sales trainers at Huthwaite International, SCOTSMAN helps you assess deals against eight critical criteria:

- **S**olution
- **C**ompetition
- **O**riginality
- **T**imescales
- **S**ize
- **M**oney
- **A**uthority
- **N**eed

Let’s look at each element of the SCOTSMAN framework and its impact on complex sales.

## Breaking Down the SCOTSMAN Framework

### 1. Solution
**Does your offering solve the client’s problem?**  
Clarify whether your product or service maps directly to the client’s business needs, not just at a surface level but in measurable, impactful ways.

### 2. Competition
**Who else are they considering?**  
Understanding competitors involved helps you tailor your value proposition and anticipate obstacles.

### 3. Originality
**What makes your solution unique?**  
Can you demonstrate clear differentiation, or are you at risk of being seen as a commodity in the eyes of the prospect?

### 4. Timescales
**What is the client’s timeline?**  
Align your sales process with the buying window to avoid wasted effort and missed deadlines.

### 5. Size
**Is the opportunity large enough?**  
Evaluate whether the potential deal size aligns with your company’s goals and justifies the investment of resources.

### 6. Money
**Is there a budget in place?**  
Confirm that funds are available and allocated for this project, reducing the chances of last-minute financial pushback.

### 7. Authority
**Are you speaking to decision-makers?**  
Qualify whether your contacts have the power to say yes or simply influence the decision-making process.

### 8. Need
**Is there a genuine need for your offering?**  
Diagnose and validate true demand — otherwise, you risk chasing deals that will never close.

## SCOTSMAN Framework in Action: Real-World Example

Consider an enterprise software vendor pitching a cloud solution to a Fortune 500 company—a textbook complex sale. By deploying the SCOTSMAN framework, their sales team:

- Filtrates opportunities with no allocated budget,
- Identifies when competitors have a feature edge,
- Focuses their pitch on unique integration capabilities,  
- And escalates conversations only when true decision-makers are engaged.

The result? Shorter sales cycles, higher close rates, and more accurate revenue projections.
