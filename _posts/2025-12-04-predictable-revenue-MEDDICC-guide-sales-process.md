## Step-by-Step MEDDICC Guide to Build Predictable Revenue

### 1. **Metrics: Define Quantifiable Value**

Start with the numbers. Ask yourself and your prospect: What business outcomes do they want? What KPIs would they like to improve? What is the potential ROI?

*Example questions:*
- What financial targets are driving this project?
- By how much do you need to increase/decrease [specific metric]?

### 2. **Economic Buyer: Identify the True Decision Maker**

Determine who controls the budget and final sign-off. Build credibility and ensure your solution’s value resonates with this person.

*Tips:*
- Map out the organization.
- Secure a meeting with the economic buyer early in the sales process.

### 3. **Decision Criteria: Uncover Buying Requirements**

Document what your customer values most. Is it price, integration, service, time to value, etc.? Understanding this avoids mismatches and wasted effort.

*Checklist:*
- Technical requirements
- Service-level commitments
- Procurement conditions

### 4. **Decision Process: Outline the Steps to Close**

Gain clarity on each step between now and a signed deal. Who needs to approve? What is procurement’s process? 

*Checklist:*
- Proposal review meetings
- Legal and compliance checks

### 5. **Identify Pain: Make the Business Case Urgent**

Without real pain, deals stall or die. Quantify and articulate the specific issues your solution solves.

*Prompting question:*
- What risk or missed opportunity stays unresolved if they don’t act?

### 6. **Champion: Build Internal Advocates**

A champion sells your solution internally when you're not in the room. Develop and support them with success stories and assets.

*Champion checklist:*
- Level of influence
- Urgency to solve the problem
- Willingness to provide feedback

### 7. **Competition: Know Your Rivals**

Who else is the customer evaluating? What strengths or weaknesses do you have against alternatives? Prepare your differentiators in advance.
