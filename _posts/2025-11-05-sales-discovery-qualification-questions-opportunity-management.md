## What is Sales Discovery?

Sales discovery is the information-gathering phase of the sales process.

## Key Qualification Questions That Reveal Real Opportunities

### 1. What problem are you trying to solve?

This uncovers core challenges and lets you position your solution as the answer.

### 2. Why is this a priority now?

Understanding urgency guides follow-up and opportunity management. If there’s no urgency, it’s probably not a real opportunity.

### 3. Who is involved in the decision process?

Identifying stakeholders early helps you influence the right people and avoid surprises later.

### 4. What does success look like for your team?

This goes beyond features—dig into business outcomes your solution can help achieve.

### 5. Have you used similar solutions before?

Knowing their experience level helps tailor your approach and anticipate objections.

### 6. What is your timeline for making a decision?

A clear timeframe differentiates active projects from future possibilities, optimizing your opportunity management.

### 7. What budget have you allocated for this project?

Failure to discuss budget early often leads to wasted time. Qualify if your solution fits.

### 8. What challenges might prevent you from moving forward?

Uncovering possible roadblocks lets you proactively address concerns and keep deals moving.
