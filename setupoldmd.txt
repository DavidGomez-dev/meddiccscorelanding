**6. Begin Scoring**

- The first time you access a Deal, the default framework (normally MEDDICC) is used. (The default framework can be changed in the Settings.)
- Meddicc Score retrieves the relevant information of the last 100 Deal Engagements (Emails, Meetings, Calls, Tasks, Notes...) recorded in HubSpot. AI analyzes this data to auto-fill responses for the Framework Questions.
  Note: Comments to engagements are not gathered since they are not available through the HubSpot API.

- Then the AI model return a Score based on the data introduced and feedback for every step. The responses, feedback and score are stored.
- Users can manually update the pre-filled responses on the form at any time.
- Clicking on Score will trigger the AI to reassess and recalculate the Score based on updated data.

- Users can also modify the Score manually by clicking the pencil icon below the score.
- All scores are stored in HubSpot as a custom variable named "score_meddicc".

**7. Change the Framework**

- Users can select a different qualification framework for each Deal.
- AI will prepopulate the selected framework with relevant information from the Deal.
- However, switching frameworks will not automatically recalculate the Score, ensuring that old responses remain accessible.
- Users can return to the previous framework at any time.

**8. Settings: Editing the framework questions and default framework**

- Clicking the gear icon on 'Select Framework' allows you to edit the questions for that framework. The change will apply to all account members (not just the individual user). The modification will not affect the answers or scores previously submitted but will update the questions for all deals where that framework has been used.

![Editing](/assets/images/guide9.png){: .my-5 .border .border-3 .border-primary .rounded .rounded-3}

- Turning on the 'Default Framework' switch will set the selected framework as the default for the entire account. Every new deal will use this framework by default. The change will not affect the answers or frameworks previously submitted in existing deals. The default framework is initially set to MEDDICC.

### Troubleshooting

#### I cannot see Score as a custom variable / The Score in HubSpot is not updated automatically

To enable this, you may need to reauthorize the app for the new permits required. Please click here

<a href="{{ site.pwalink }}" target="_blank">![Install](/assets/images/installBtn.png)</a>

You may also need before that, to have permits to add new properties (or someone else who has authorized the app with permits).

![troubleshooting](/assets/images/trouble1.png){: .my-5 .border .border-3 .border-primary .rounded .rounded-3}

It would be possible also to create the variable manually. It can be done in Settings:

![troubleshooting](/assets/images/trouble12.png){: .my-5 .border .border-3 .border-primary .rounded .rounded-3}

It is very important to make it work that:

- the internal name be exactly "score_meddicc"
- Object type is "Deal"
- Group is "Deal information"

![troubleshooting](/assets/images/trouble2.png){: .my-5 .w-50 .border .border-3 .border-primary .rounded .rounded-3}

#### The AI Autofill is not taking information from my Emails

To enable this, you may need to reauthorize the app for the new permits required (access to read emails basically). Please click here:

<a href="{{ site.pwalink }}" target="_blank">![Install](/assets/images/installBtn.png){: .w-10}
</a>

In all cases, the information extracted from emails is limited to the initial portion of each email. This helps avoid processing repetitive long threads, legal disclaimers, and other non-essential content. However, if critical Deal information is buried deep within the email threads or other engagements, the AI might not capture or interpret it accurately.

#### How can add a discount code

On the checkout Stripe page, there is a button 'Add Code' where you can add yu discount code. The price will be automatically updated. If you face any problem or the code not longer works, please [Contact Us]("{{ site.email }}"):
