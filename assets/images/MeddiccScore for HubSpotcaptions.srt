00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,639
Hello!

2
00:00:00,639 --> 00:00:02,786
If you are working in complex deals,

3
00:00:02,786 --> 00:00:05,049
sales frameworks like Meddicc, Bant or

4
00:00:05,049 --> 00:00:07,198
Spiced, can be invaluable tools to

5
00:00:07,198 --> 00:00:09,102
qualify the deal, ask the right

6
00:00:09,102 --> 00:00:10,925
questions, and progress the deal to

7
00:00:10,925 --> 00:00:11,781
closure.

8
00:00:11,807 --> 00:00:13,665
However, implementing these frameworks

9
00:00:13,665 --> 00:00:15,522
in HubSpot is often complex and

10
00:00:15,522 --> 00:00:16,521
time-consuming.

11
00:00:16,521 --> 00:00:18,657
With Meddicc Score, we’ve created the

12
00:00:18,657 --> 00:00:20,508
simplest way to bring them to life —

13
00:00:20,508 --> 00:00:23,429
using AI to automatically fill, score,

14
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:25,208
and coach your team with ease.

15
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:26,499
Let’s see it in action!

16
00:00:26,999 --> 00:00:29,530
Imagine you are currently working on a

17
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,365
new deal that already has some records

18
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,664
such as notes, emails, calls or

19
00:00:33,664 --> 00:00:34,349
meetings.

20
00:00:34,349 --> 00:00:36,392
We can use this information to

21
00:00:36,392 --> 00:00:38,508
automatically fill the framework form.

22
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,283
The Meddics Score card appears on the

23
00:00:40,283 --> 00:00:41,827
right side or in the middle of your

24
00:00:41,827 --> 00:00:42,663
Deal record.

25
00:00:42,663 --> 00:00:45,148
You can click on 'Update score' and the

26
00:00:45,148 --> 00:00:46,750
AI will first use the existing

27
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,340
information to fill the selected

28
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,281
framework form.

29
00:00:49,281 --> 00:00:51,661
You can also add more information to

30
00:00:51,661 --> 00:00:52,961
complete the questions.

31
00:00:52,961 --> 00:00:55,260
Upon clicking on 'score', the AI will

32
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,153
provide you with a score for the Deal,

33
00:00:57,153 --> 00:00:59,289
individual feedback and recommend next

34
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:01,135
steps to progress to closure.

35
00:01:02,135 --> 00:01:03,273
New record?

36
00:01:03,273 --> 00:01:05,931
no worries, with automations whenever a

37
00:01:05,931 --> 00:01:07,545
new record is logged, it will be

38
00:01:07,545 --> 00:01:09,066
re-considered and the score will be

39
00:01:09,066 --> 00:01:10,308
automatically updated.

40
00:01:11,808 --> 00:01:14,409
Meddicc score can also be accessed from

41
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:15,477
the contact record.

42
00:01:15,477 --> 00:01:17,857
There, you can view all the deals

43
00:01:17,857 --> 00:01:20,098
associated with that contact, along

44
00:01:20,098 --> 00:01:21,689
with a personalized action plan

45
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:23,407
featuring the recommended next steps

46
00:01:23,407 --> 00:01:24,301
for them.

47
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:24,777
.

48
00:01:24,777 --> 00:01:26,774
This includes potential talking points

49
00:01:26,774 --> 00:01:28,144
and questions that you may ask the

50
00:01:28,144 --> 00:01:29,966
contact to progress on the deal.

51
00:01:29,966 --> 00:01:32,788
You even have an email already drafted,

52
00:01:32,788 --> 00:01:34,529
tailored with the information from the

53
00:01:34,529 --> 00:01:35,796
deal.

54
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:38,957
Similarly, in companies, you can find a

55
00:01:38,957 --> 00:01:40,733
list of all the deals and contacts

56
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:42,777
related to that company with the key

57
00:01:42,777 --> 00:01:44,425
information needed to progress on the

58
00:01:44,425 --> 00:01:45,481
deal closure.

59
00:01:46,008 --> 00:01:47,935
