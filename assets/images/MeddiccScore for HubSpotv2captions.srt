00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,604
Hello!

2
00:00:00,604 --> 00:00:02,762
If you are working in complex deals,

3
00:00:02,762 --> 00:00:05,235
sales frameworks like Meddicc, Bant or

4
00:00:05,235 --> 00:00:07,628
Spiced, can be invaluable tools to

5
00:00:07,628 --> 00:00:09,694
qualify the deal, ask the right

6
00:00:09,694 --> 00:00:11,493
questions, and progress the deal to

7
00:00:11,493 --> 00:00:12,355
closure.

8
00:00:12,382 --> 00:00:14,298
However, implementing these frameworks

9
00:00:14,298 --> 00:00:16,295
in HubSpot is often complex and

10
00:00:16,295 --> 00:00:17,305
time-consuming.

11
00:00:17,305 --> 00:00:19,720
With Meddicc Score, we’ve created the

12
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,571
simplest way to bring them to life —

13
00:00:21,571 --> 00:00:24,503
using AI to automatically fill, score,

14
00:00:24,503 --> 00:00:26,436
and coach your team with ease.

15
00:00:26,462 --> 00:00:27,704
Let’s see it in action!

16
00:00:28,204 --> 00:00:30,642
Imagine you are currently working on a

17
00:00:30,642 --> 00:00:32,570
new deal that already has some records

18
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,776
such as notes, emails, calls or

19
00:00:34,776 --> 00:00:35,449
meetings.

20
00:00:35,449 --> 00:00:37,399
We can use this information to

21
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:39,527
automatically fill the framework form.

22
00:00:39,549 --> 00:00:41,232
The Meddics Score card appears on the

23
00:00:41,232 --> 00:00:42,765
right side or in the middle of your

24
00:00:42,765 --> 00:00:43,671
Deal record.

25
00:00:43,671 --> 00:00:46,527
You can click on 'Update score' and the

26
00:00:46,527 --> 00:00:48,117
AI will first use the existing

27
00:00:48,117 --> 00:00:49,685
information to fill the selected

28
00:00:49,685 --> 00:00:50,602
framework form.

29
00:00:50,602 --> 00:00:53,202
You can also add more information to

30
00:00:53,202 --> 00:00:54,525
complete the questions.

31
00:00:54,525 --> 00:00:57,254
Upon clicking on 'score', the AI will

32
00:00:57,254 --> 00:00:59,111
provide you with a score for the Deal,

33
00:00:59,111 --> 00:01:01,828
individual feedback and recommend next

34
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,477
steps to progress to closure.

35
00:01:04,477 --> 00:01:05,684
New record?

36
00:01:05,684 --> 00:01:08,749
no worries, with automations whenever a

37
00:01:08,749 --> 00:01:10,421
new record is logged, it will be

38
00:01:10,421 --> 00:01:11,988
re-considered and the score will be

39
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,277
automatically updated.

40
00:01:14,777 --> 00:01:17,378
Meddicc score can also be accessed from

41
00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:18,469
the contact record.

42
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:20,443
There, you can view all the deals

43
00:01:20,443 --> 00:01:22,672
associated with that contact, along

44
00:01:22,672 --> 00:01:24,146
with a personalized action plan

45
00:01:24,146 --> 00:01:25,841
featuring the recommended next steps

46
00:01:25,841 --> 00:01:26,898
for them.

47
00:01:26,898 --> 00:01:27,588
.

48
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,974
This includes potential talking points

49
00:01:29,974 --> 00:01:31,484
and questions that you may ask the

50
00:01:31,484 --> 00:01:33,132
contact to progress on the deal.

51
00:01:33,132 --> 00:01:35,629
You even have an email already drafted,

52
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:37,254
tailored with the information from the

53
00:01:37,254 --> 00:01:38,401
deal.

54
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:41,557
Similarly, in companies, you can find a

55
00:01:41,557 --> 00:01:43,322
list of all the deals and contacts

56
00:01:43,322 --> 00:01:44,936
related to that company with the key

57
00:01:44,936 --> 00:01:46,654
information needed to progress on the

58
00:01:46,654 --> 00:01:47,676
deal closure.

59
00:01:48,202 --> 00:01:49,827
