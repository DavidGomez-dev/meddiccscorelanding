Hello!

2
00:00:00,604 --> 00:00:02,762
If you are working in complex deals,

3
00:00:02,762 --> 00:00:05,235
sales frameworks like Meddicc, Bant or

4
00:00:05,235 --> 00:00:07,628
Spiced, can be invaluable tools to

5
00:00:07,628 --> 00:00:09,694
qualify the deal, ask the right

6
00:00:09,694 --> 00:00:11,493
questions, and progress the deal to

7
00:00:11,493 --> 00:00:12,355
closure.

8
00:00:12,382 --> 00:00:14,391
However, implementing these frameworks

9
00:00:14,391 --> 00:00:16,260
in Zoho is often complex and

10
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,444
time-consuming.

11
00:00:17,444 --> 00:00:19,632
With Meddicc Score, we’ve created the

12
00:00:19,632 --> 00:00:21,458
simplest way to bring them to life —

13
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:24,201
using AI to automatically fill, score,

14
00:00:24,201 --> 00:00:25,902
and coach your team with ease.

15
00:00:26,932 --> 00:00:28,651
Let’s see it in action!

16
00:00:29,151 --> 00:00:31,188
Imagine you are currently working on a

17
00:00:31,188 --> 00:00:33,126
new deal that already has some records

18
00:00:33,126 --> 00:00:35,548
such as notes, emails, calls or

19
00:00:35,548 --> 00:00:36,499
meetings.

20
00:00:36,499 --> 00:00:38,206
We can use this information to

21
00:00:38,206 --> 00:00:40,493
automatically fill the framework form.

22
00:00:40,993 --> 00:00:43,002
The Meddics Score card appears on your

23
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:45,092
list of items of your Deal record.

24
00:00:45,092 --> 00:00:47,507
You can click on 'Refill' and the AI

25
00:00:47,507 --> 00:00:49,457
will first use the existing information

26
00:00:49,457 --> 00:00:51,698
to fill the selected framework form.

27
00:00:51,698 --> 00:00:53,724
You can also add more information to

28
00:00:53,724 --> 00:00:55,169
complete the questions.

29
00:00:55,169 --> 00:00:57,613
Upon clicking on 'score' , the AI will

30
00:00:57,613 --> 00:00:59,494
provide you with a score for the Deal,

31
00:00:59,494 --> 00:01:01,665
individual feedback and recommend next

32
00:01:01,665 --> 00:01:03,309
steps to progress to closure.

33
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:06,307

quarter.

37
00:01:09,924 --> 00:01:12,170

38
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:12,959
